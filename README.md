# Housing Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains a predictive model for housing prices developed in Python. 

The model analyzes various factors that influence house values, utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle. 

The project covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and the application of a linear regression model to identify key price drivers.

## Project Components

- **Data Acquisition**: The dataset is obtained from Kaggle, consisting of diverse features related to housing prices.

- **Identify Price Drivers**: A systematic approach to uncover significant predictors of house value, informed by domain knowledge and data analysis.

- **Data Cleaning**: Rigorous data preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and data transformation to ensure quality input for the model.

- **Data Visualization**: Utilization of Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful visualizations, aiding in understanding underlying patterns and relationships.

- **Model Development**: Application of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using statsmodels to estimate the relationships between house prices and potential predictors.


## Results

The OLS regression model achieved an R-squared value of 0.588, demonstrating a moderate to strong ability to predict housing prices based on the dataset provided. 

Further tuning and validation are necessary to improve model performance and ensure generalization to unseen data.
